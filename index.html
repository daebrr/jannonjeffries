        <h2>Flow Builder Adoption</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Merchants spend the majority of their time on Postscript, an SMS marketing platform, creating and managing their SMS campaigns and automations.
          Flow Builder allows them to accomplish this more easily by introducing multi-message functionality within
          a single SMS campaign or automation.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>There is limited functionality and support for the current tools merchants are accustomed to using;
          however, merchants are wary of change and have been slow to adopt Flow Builder&mdash;in turn, missing
          out on improved features that can help make their jobs easier.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Legacy vs. Flow Builder</h3>
        <p>The legacy SMS campaign experience (below left) uses outdated design system components and has limited functionality
          such as a single-message restriction and lack of branching capabilities. Meanwhile, the Flow Builder experience (below right)
          supports single-message use cases as well as more complex flows that include important functionality
          like A/B testing.

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We talked with Customer Success Managers and the main points of feedback were:
            <ul>
              <li>No easy way to A/B test messages in the legacy experience</li>
              <li>No way to exclude specific customers from a segment in the legacy experience</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>We also received feedback from merchants via a widget on the home page:
            <ul>
              <li>Roughly 70% of users find Flow Builder easy to use</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How might we...drive adoption of Flow Builder?
          <ul>
            <li>How might we...increase the number of messages merchants are sending?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
          <li>How might we...help decrease the amount of time it takes to learn Flow Builder?</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>As the lead Product Designer on the project, I interviewed merchants about their experience using Flow Builder.
          In addition to running customer interviews, I created a Pendo survey soliciting asynchronous feedback and utilized Amplitude
          to track Flow Builder usage. I also worked closely with Product and Engineering by conducting a workship to highlight
          opportunities for increasing adoption.

        <h3>Enhancements</h3>
      <p>We made the following updates to the product in hopes of boosting Flow Builder usage:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Surface a “Try Flow Builder” option within the legacy SMS campaign and automation experiences</li>
          <li>Add template options for SMS campaign and automation flows to make building flows easier</li>
          <li>Create an option to convert legacy SMS automations to automation flows</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Objectives follow-up</h3>
        The updates we made to the experience resulted in an increase of ~700% for Flow Builder usage. We also saw 
        ~25% of merchants who interacted with the “Try Flow Builder” button continue to create a flow.
        </ul>
        <hr>
        
      <h3>Next steps</h3>
      <p>In order to sunset the legacy experience, we are working towards product pairity between tthe legacy experience and Flow Builder.</p>

      <h2>Custom Variant Support</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Postscript, an SMS marketing platform, recently released new functionality
        (called Text-to-Buy) that allows customers to purchase products via the text thread.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>Since Text-to-Buy is still in Beta status, it does not provide all the capabilities
        merchants are seeking. On average, our enterprise level merchants have 5 options
        per product that require their customers to make a selection (e.g. size, color, etc.),
        but the current implementation requires merchants to make this choice on behalf of their
        customers. Since merchants have a limited knowledge of their customers' personal details,
        they opt out of using Text-to-Buy in its current state.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Original experience</h3>
      <p>Currently, the Text-to-Buy experience requires merchants to select a product
        and all its options before sending out a Text-to-Buy campaign.</p>

        <li>Feedback via Customer Success Managers
          <ul>
            <li>
              A few merchants who had been onboarded into the program
              decided to opt out because the majority of their best-selling products require customer selection. 
            </li>

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>As the lead Product Designer on the project, I iterated through several ideas and shared them
        with the Postscript design team for feedback. After sharing the refined designs with Product and
        Engineering, I used UsabilityHub to run a series of usability tests, comparing different approaches.
        I shared the findings with my team and led a kickoff meeting where I aligned with Engineering on requirements.</p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>We ran two rounds of usability testing. For the first round, users ran through 2 mobile-simulated experiences
        on their computers. The first prototype had them place an order solely in the text thread, while the second
        prototype had users go back and forth between the text thread and a web checkout experience.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>80% of users said the text thread experience was easy to follow.</li>
        <li>80% of users said the web checkout experience was easy to follow.</li>
        <li>When asked to compare the two experiences, 60% of users preferred the text thread experience.</li>
        <li>"Texting is in the same spot for the customer to respond, which makes it easier for them to
          complete the task and order rather than navigating to another website." - Test Participant</li>
      </ul>

        <p>(Above left) The text-based prototype, (Above right) The web-based prototype</p>
      </div>

      <p>Since the results of the initial usability test were very similar, we decided to iterate on
        the two experiences further and test again. This time, we were able to test on mobile devices
        to ensure the most authentic experience for test participants. </p>
        <p>
        The first prototype still took
        place entirely in the text thread, but the selection process was simplified furthered. Meanwhile,
        the second prototype was updated so that only the first step took place in the text thread and
        the rest of the experience was on mobile web. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>~83% of users said the text thread experience was easy to follow.</li>
        <li>~67% of users said the web checkout experience was easy to follow.</li>
        <li>Overall, ~83% of users preferred the text thread experience over the web checkout experience.<br>

      <h3>New designs</h3>
      <p>Once we had our kickoff meeting surrounding the project, we uncovered some possible limitations
        in the winning Usability Hub design. Therefore, as an MVP, we slightly shifted our approach 
        by scaling back complexity and focusing on products that only have one customizable option.
        However, once we get validation from the new implementation, the team will spike on how we can
        leverage our data to make the winning design a reality.</p>

      <h3>Next steps</h3>
      <p>
        This project is currently in development, so we do not have any data surrounding our main
        objective around increasing Text-to-Buy usage. However, once the update is made, we will
        create product release materials to share with Postscript merchants and garner more feedback
        from the merchants that our currently using Text-to-Buy.

        <h2>House Rules</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Homeowners that use Vrbo, a vacation rental platform, set property rules travelers must agree to prior to booking. These rules encompass items like max
          occupancy, minimum renter age, allowance of pets, and several other rules.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Hosts cancel on travelers due to confusion surrounding house rules. Vrbo has over 13,000 cancellations
          annually because of house rules. The result is unhappy customers and a loss of revenue.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Original experience</h3>
        <p>There have been a lot of concerns surrounding the original house rules experience for both hosts and
          travelers. For example, one early study found travelers less inclined to book a property when custom notes
          were included in the house
          rules. (The outlined sections pictured above are areas for custom content.)</p>

        <p>As the lead Product Designer on the project, I attended weekly progress meetings with the Product Manager,
          Technical Project Manager, Marketing Specialist, and Content Strategist. I also worked closely with the
          traveler designer to ensure there was consistency across the host and traveler experience.
          Lastly, I regularly shared my working designs at our host team design critique for transparency and feedback.

        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>Our UX Researcher performed a remote moderated study where 9 participants walked through a multi-step

          <li>If each rule provided enough options for hosts</li>

        <h3>New designs</h3>
        <p>After updating some of the content and syncing with the Engineering team about scope, we were able to push
          forward with an updated version of house rules.</p>
        <h4>A look at the new design</h4>
        <p>The new host design utilizes components from the Vrbo design system, allowing hosts to always have the save
          action within view. The content in the host view is also clearly represented in the traveler view as the host
          intended.</p>

        </div>
        <h4>A comparison between an old rule and a new rule</h4>
        <p>The original rule included an "on/off" state as well as options for "yes" and "no". The new rule has only the
          "yes" and "no" options with other more specific inputs inspired by early user research.</p>

        <h4>Rule states</h4>
        <p>In order to provide the Engineers with clarity, each rule has been broken down into its different states.
          Using progressive disclosure, we only surface relevant content when the appropriate rule choice is selected.

      <h3>Objectives follow-up</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No amount of new structured rules will be sufficient to replace custom content for hosts with unique
          properties.</li>
        <li>Since the release of the new house rules design, conversions have increased.</li>
        <li>Because house rules have been added to the onboarding experience, 100% of new users are completing them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h3>Next steps</h3>
      <p>To improve the house rules experience even further, we plan to add more rules after implementing additional
        natural language processing for host custom rules and notes.</p>

      <h2>Cancel and change</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>When using Vrbo, a vacation rental platform, hosts must sometimes change or cancel a guest's reservation if the need arises.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>When a host cancels on a guest, everyone loses. The guest is disappointed, the host's search rank falls, and
        Vrbo loses out on revenue. Host cancellations contribute to 10% of reported guest pain points and current
        limitations of the reservations cancel and change capabilities lead to millions of dollars in operational
        costs&mdash;not including the revenue lost for Vrbo and hosts.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Original experience</h3>
      <h4>Canceling a reservation</h4>
      <p>The original cancel experience has led to a lack of trust between travelers and hosts. In this experience,
        hosts are not required to explain to the guest why they are canceling.</p>
      <div class="large-image-container">
        <img class="project-image-large image-border" src="images/projects/cancel-change/cancel/original.png"
          alt="Original cancellation screen">
      </div>
      <h4>Changing a reservation</h4>
      <p>The original change experience does not allow a host to add a payment request or issue a refund. These actions
        can be taken immediately following the flow, but there is little direction for hosts about how to handle these
        situations.</p>

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>As the lead Product Designer, I had weekly meetings with the Product Manager and Content Strategist on the

        <li>During the host design team's UX critique meeting, I would often share my work for feedback.</li>
        <li>I researched competitor designs (like Airbnb and Booking.com).</li>
        <li>I presented the most recent designs to internal stakeholder for additional feedback and suggestions.</li>
        <li>The larger host design team held a design swarm where one of the flows explored was the host change flow.
          <ul>
            <li>We created artifacts such as how-might-we statements, core user flows, and sketches. (Pictured below)
            </li>
            <li>At the end of the swarm, we created a prototype that included a flow for changing a reservation.</li>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>While we are currently working with the research team to test the newest cancellation and change flows, we have
        gained some insights from the swarm usability study:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Participants appreciated a certain level of automation when approving guest-initiated changes</li>
        <li>Participants wanted to be notified of guest changes via several different communication channels</li>
        <li>When changing a reservation, participants admitted to only changing one item (like dates or guest count) at
          a time</li>

      <h3>New designs</h3>
      <p>Though we are still waiting on the next round of testing to begin, the new designs are based off previous
        research and extensive
        feedback.</p>
      <h4>Canceling a reservation</h4>
      <p>The new design adds friction against canceling at the top of the panel. We have also added a new required step of
        submitting additional context for every cancellation reason. </p>

          alt="The first step of the cancellation process, after a host selects their reason for canceling">
      </div>
      <p>For host cancellations, we want to require 100% refund for guests since it is not their fault for these kinds of
        cancellations.</p>

          alt="A screen with a disclaimer detailing what will happen when the host confirms the cancellation">
      </div>
      <p>Though we may not be able to prevent all cancellations, we can at least help prevent future cancellations by
        prompting hosts to sync their calendars and avoid double bookings. This coaching is specific to the reason the
        host is canceling on the guest.</p>

      </div>
      <h4>Changing a reservation</h4>
      <p>The options to change a reservation are now surfaced with the option to cancel. This allows for more
        scalability as change functionality grows.</p>

          alt="The list of options a host will see when choosing to change or cancel a reservation">
      </div>
      <p>The new design gives hosts the option to view their calendar availability when choosing to change a
        reservation's dates. In the past, host have provided feedback concerning how they prefer to view their
        availability via the calendar.</p>
      <div class="large-image-container">

      </div>
      <p>We have also included the ability to add a payment request or issue a refund within the change flow. The option

        While working on the vacation rental designs, we have also been working on designs for larger hosts like hotel
        owners. Our
        two products, vacation rentals and hotels, are headed towards convergence and the cancel/edit experiences lend
        themselves as an optimal place
        for consistency.

      <h2>Decline coaching</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Vrbo is a vacation rental platform that allows homeowners to rent out their property. Homeowners/hosts can approve or decline a traveler's request to book their property. The decline flow allows hosts to
        explain why they cannot host a guest.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>Host declines lead to disappointed travelers and a loss of revenue. Vrbo loses out on millions of dollars
        annually due
        to host declines. If hosts had an easier way to keep their settings and calendars up-to-date, a bulk
        of these declines could be prevented.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Original experience</h3>
      <p>The initial decline experience provides friction for hosts&mdash;possibly too much with the red symbol and
        dramatic red text. This design attempts to scare the host out of declining, rather than persuading them to
        approve.

      <p>Based on user feedback, we were able to pare down the reasons for declining a reservation request. We also
        opted to add a step mid-flow to block a host's availability. Lastly, depending on the decline reason, we
        implemented coaching either mid-flow or post-flow to help hosts save requests or prevent future declines.</p>

      <p>We used an A/B test to determine if the new designs had a positive impact on booking acceptance rates and
        a negative impact on booking decline rates.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        After a few months, we were able to validate our designs and pushed the new experience live for all users.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Objectives follow-up</h3>
      <p>
        Since the new experience has been live for all users, we have seen the following changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Acceptance rate +2.3%</li>
        <li>Decline rate -2.9%</li>
        <li>The selection of the "Longer stay required" reason has drastically decreased. This is most likely due to the
          new
          design coaching hosts to edit the request instead of declining.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h3>Next steps</h3>
      <p>
        Since implementing new decline reasons, we have learned that many hosts are now selecting "Dates booked on another
        platform" (22%) when declining a booking request. This tells us that many hosts that list their properties on
        multiple websites are still not
        syncing their calendars between platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the new designs, we are exposing more hosts to the calendar sync functionality, but we still have a ways to
        go. The next step forward is to simplify the calendar sync process by exploring automation through app
        permissions.

      <h2>Inbox redesign</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>While interacting with Vrbo, a vacation rental platform, hosts spend the majority of their time managing reservations and messaging guests via their inbox. The inbox
        page is the second most visited page on Vrbo.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>The inbox is home to booking requests, guest messages, cancellations, and so much more. Therefore, it holds a
        lot of value. That being said, there is a lack of urgency with hosts responding to guests&mdash;especially when
        it comes to inquiries (messages without a booking request attached). 10% of Vrbo's revenue can be traced back to
        inquiries, but only 3% of inquiries turn into full-fledged reservations.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Original experience</h3>
      <p>The original design treats every message with the same sense of urgency. There is no indication of unread
        messages or actions a host needs to take on a specific reservation.</p>

        <li>UX hueristic evaluation*
          <ul>
            <li>Participants had difficulty differentiating between read and unread messages</li>
            <li>Participants did not understand how to filter or sort messages</li>
            <li>The icon options provided no accompanying content explanation</li>

        <li>Design swarm
          <ul>
            <li>While contributing to a larger design swarm, we were able to put early ideas in front of test
              participants</li>
            <li>One idea was to incorporate colored badging for booking status</li>
            <li>This idea was received well by all participants</li>

      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>How might we...drive hosts to respond more quickly?</li>
        <li>How might we...make filters more useful for hosts?</li>
        <li>How might we...provide a mobile-first experience?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>During the aforementioned design swarm, our team was able to do a lot of competitive and analogus
        research pertaining to how other inbox-like designs were constructed. Utlizing the swarm artifacts, I worked as
        the lead Product Designer on the inbox redesign. I regularly met with the Product Manager, Engineers, and the Content
        Strategist to convey progress and troubleshoot issues with working designs. </p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>Our UX Researcher performed a remote moderated study where 9 participants walked through a native prototype. We
        were looking for feedback on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How easily hosts could find inquiries</li>
        <li>How useful hosts found the new filter system</li>
        <li>How hosts felt about taking action from an inbox-level</li>
        <li>How hosts felt about using swipe and long press functionality on native</li>
      </ul>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="note center">
        <p>In the prototype pictured above, participants were able to send a payment request reminder from the inbox.
          Participants were also able to utilize native-specific functionality like swiping in order to perform certain
          tasks.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <h3>Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>9/9 participants were able to easily differentiate unread inquiries from other messages</li>
        <li>8/9 participants discovered filters at a glance</li>
        <li>8/9 participants found the booking status badges useful</li>
        <li>Participants did not find the swiping functionality to be intuitive</li>
        <li>One participant said, “I like it. It's cleaner. It's more app-like. It's easier to use. More user friendly.
          Overall, big
          improvement.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>New designs</h3>
      <h4>A new experience with clearer booking statuses</h4>
      <p>The new design not only highlights the booking status better than the original experience, but depending on the
        booking status, inline coaching maybe present to help hosts act more quickly when they need to. We have also added
        the estimated payout to inquiries and booking requests to help incentivize action.</p>

        <img class="project-image-large" src="images/projects/inbox/new1.png" alt="The inbox design for desktop web">
      </div>
      <h4>A mobile-first experience</h4>
      <p>We started designing the new mobile experience and worked up to desktop&mdash;leveraging native iOS components
        to
        make implementing more efficient for our Engineers.</p>
      <div class="large-image-container">
        <img class="project-image-large" src="images/projects/inbox/new2.png"
          alt="A look at different inbox screens on iOS">
      </div>
      <p>Another way we hope to increase response and acceptance rates is by surfacing response and booking acceptance
        metrics to hosts. If a
        host's acceptance rate falls below a certain threshhold, we can coach them to do better. </p>

      <h3>Objectives follow-up</h3>
      <p>
        This experience has not been implemented yet, but stakeholders are expecting a noteworthy impact in response
        times and acceptance rates.
      </p>

      <h3>Next steps</h3>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the future, we want to add the ability to cancel inquiries in order to urge for host action on inquiries.
        </li>
        <li>Currently, there is another page very similar to the Inbox called the Reservations List. We are
          exploring ways to consolidate functionality and create a single experience.
