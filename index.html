        <h2>Automation Flow Versioning</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Postscript, an SMS marketing platform, allows merchants to send automated messages (called automation flows) to their customers. Recently, new functionality has been added that allows merchants to see previous versions of their flows.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>On average, 178 SMS merchants edit their automation flows every week. However, sometimes these edits result in a negative impact to their revenue, so merchants end up wanting to revert their changes. Up until recently, there was no way for merchants to revert their changes and also no easy way to compare analytics to previous automation versions. This lack of functionality not only led to frustration for Postscript customers, but prevented prospects from switching to Postscript from competitor platforms (that did provide this fucntionality).</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Original experience</h3>
        <p>The original experience for automation flows only showcased the most up-to-date version of a flow along with its unique analytics.</p>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Feedback via Customers and Customer Success Managers
            <ul>
              <li>“They are frustrated they cannot see past data on old edits of automations. They feel this is key to their ability to test.” (A Customer Success Manager talking about their customer)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Customer Interviews
            <ul>
              <li>While on a call with at least one customer, the customer noted that they had provided (recent) feedback to their CSM about wanting the ability to review data from previous versions of automation flows. (They were manually tracking their edits at the time of the call.)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Amplitude Data
            <ul>
              <li>On average, a shop can have up to 24 versions of a single automation flow.</li>
              <li>178 SMS merchants are updating their automations on a weekly basis. </li>
            </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How might we...help merchants track changes they make to their automation flows?</li>
          <li>How might we...empower merchants to optimize their automation flows according to analytics?</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>As the lead Product Designer on the project, I worked closely with a Product Manager, digging into analogous research and customer feedback. I created several different mock-ups and shared them with my team for feedback. Upon receiving feedback from Product, Engineering, and other designers, I continued to iterate until I felt the designs were in a polished enough state for usability testing.</p>
        <div class="large-image-container">
          <img class="project-image-large" src="images/projects/versioning/3_ideation.jpg"
            alt="Figma file with iterations and team comments">
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>I conducted an unmoderated usability test using UsabilityHub, where 8 participants walked through a Figma prototype. The results are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Totals
            <ul>
              <li>Total participants: 8 participants</li>
              <li>Total clicks to navigate prototype: 92 clicks</li>
              <li>Total clicks on first screen: 59 clicks</li>
              <li>Total misclicks for all steps: 37%</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Averages
            <ul>
              <li>Avg clicks to complete task: 14 clicks</li>
              <li>Avg time to complete task: 57s</li>
              <li>8/8 users reached the goal screen</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="large-image-container">
          <img class="project-image-large" src="images/projects/versioning/5_testing2.jpg"
            alt="Heatmap of first clicks in the UsabilityHub study">
            <div class="note center">
              <p>(Above) A heatmap displaying first clicks for the prototype</p>
            </div>        </div>
       
        <p>Initially, I was concerned with how many participants would struggle to locate the version history drawer. (Version history could be accessed via an overflow button in the top right corner. This placement seemed to be a standard pattern across other versioning functionality in applications like Google Docs.) Most misclicks did occur during this initial step; however, all participants were able to discover the version history drawer and successfully complete the task.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="note center">
          <p>(Above) Prototype from external usability test</p>
        </div> 

        <p>In addition to the external test, I had 4 internal Messaging Strategists walk through a prototype, identifying key differences in the multiple automation versions. All 4 participants easily navigated through the prototype and correctly accounted for the flow changes.</p>
        <div class="large-image-container">
          <img class="project-image-large image-border" src="images/projects/versioning/6_testing3.jpg"
            alt="Internal usability test conducted with messaging strategists">
        </div>
        <div class="note center">
          <p>(Above) Prototype from internal usability test</p>
        </div>
        <p>One interesting point discussed in the internal feedback was around the “Changes” in the version history drawer. One strategist asked if the changes could be automated, so the system could record the changes and populate them in the section without an individual having to manually record them. (This idea unfortunately didn't make the cut for the initial feature release, but it's something the team will be looking into at a later time.)</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>New designs</h3>
        <p>When a merchant makes changes to their automation, they are prompted to confirm their changes and add details regarding what changed.</p>
        <div class="large-image-container">
          <img class="project-image-large image-border" src="images/projects/versioning/7_final1.jpg"
            alt="A merchant adding a description for their changes">
        </div> <div class="note center">
          <p>(Above) A feature where a merchant can document their flow changes</p>
        </div>
       
There is a button at the top right corner of an automation flow that opens the version history drawer.
<ul>
  <li>A merchant also has the ability to restore a previous version if they want to revert their changes or find that a previous version performed better than the current version. (A “Duplicate as New Flow” action will also be added in the future.)</li>
</li>
<li>  Once the version history drawer is open, a merchant can select an individual version they'd like to view, and the preview on the left side of the screen will update accordingly.
</li>
</ul>
<div class="large-image-container">

    alt="Version history drawer with a previous automation flow selected">
</div>
<div class="note center">
  <p>(Above) When a merchant selects a previous version and the preview updates</p>
</div>
        <p>While the mock-ups above were what was originally envisioned, there were some limitations our team had to address concerning the drawer UI. Working closely with a FE Engineer, we discovered that a drawer spanning the full height of the screen was not possible due to the page layout component our engineers leverage.</p>

        <div class="large-image-container">
          <img class="project-image-large image-border" src="images/projects/versioning/9_final3.jpg"
            alt="Version history design implemented by engineers">
        </div>
        <div class="note center">
          <p>(Above) The currently implemented version history drawer design</p>
        </div>

          <p>We went back and forth on how to solve for this limitation and we eventually landed on the decision to reuse a pre-existing UI container component that sits within the flow grid view. While this does significantly limit the space of the version history drawer, we were able to reduce some of the initial vertical space in the data cards to maximize what a merchant could see while the drawer was opened.</p>
        
      
        <p>Post-release, we also received feedback from our CTO. Despite the average number of versions for a single automation being under 30, our CTO wanted us to account for scalability in order to not overload the database in the future. After mocking up several different options and getting feedback from the design team, I landed on a skeleton loading state in order to decrease "users' perception of a long loading time" (<a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/skeleton-screens/#Animated%20Skeleton%20Screens">Nielsen Norman Group</a>, 2023).  Once 20 automation flows are loaded, we seamlessly load another 20 automation flows into the drawer as a merchant is scrolling. </p>

        <hr>
        <h3>Objectives follow-up</h3>
        <p>After the new version history functionality was released to 100% of customers, we saw the version history drawer accessed 50+ times on average in any given week. We've also seen that ~5% of merchants who access the drawer use the "Restore Version" functionality in order to optimize their automations based on success metrics (like revenue and orders).
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <p>The next steps for expanding on the version history functionality include adding a duplication action for an automation flow and automating the description creation when a change is made to an automation flow.</li>

        <h2>Flow Builder Workshops</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>There were several instances in the last year where the Flow Builder team leveraged the use of workshops in order to achieve a goal. Having led several sessions, I wanted to highlight a few important ones.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Why workshop?</h3>
      <p>Workshops are used to solve important problems and generate ideas in a highly collaborate way. While similar outcomes can sometimes be achieved by an individual, including a group or team in the process can generate more and often better ideas. It is because of this reason that I led the Flow Builder team through two important workshops in 2023.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Flow Builder Navigability Workshop</h3>
      <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <p>The first workshop I led was in response to internal feedback about a navigability issue in Flow Builder. There were some known spacing issues inside of the Flow Builder tool; however, the issues were amplified after a recent feature release. These spacing issues made it extremely difficult for individuals to navigate Flow Builder.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, our team didn't have the bandwidth for a complex solution; therefore, I proposed that we try a <a target="_blank" class="inline-link" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/workshop-activities/#articleBody">post-up</a> exercise to generate possible solutions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="large-image-container column">
        <img class="project-image-small image-border" src="images/projects/workshops/1.gif"
          alt="A gif demonstrating the spacing issue within the Flow Builder tool">
          <div class="note center">
            <p>(Above) A video sent from an internal stakeholder</p>
          </div>
      </div>
    
     </div>
      
      <p>During the post-up exercise, each team member had a set amount of time to generate ideas on their own. Next, we sorted the ideas into broader categories and took additional time to vote on the post-its or categories that resonated the most with us. After voting, we discussed the ideas with the most votes.</p>
      <div class="large-image-container">
        <img class="project-image-large image-border" src="images/projects/workshops/2_nav1.jpg"
          alt="Figjam with post-up activity to brainstorm improvements to navigation in Flow Builder">
      </div>
      <div class="note center">
        <p>(Above) The Figjam our team used to brainstorm ideas</p>
      </div>
    
   <p>Lastly, after the brainstorming session, I placed the most-voted on ideas in an Impact Effort Matrix. I then moved post-its around according to team feedback.</p>
      
      <div class="large-image-container">
        <img class="project-image-large image-border" src="images/projects/workshops/3_nav2.jpg"
          alt="Impact Effort matrix that idenitifies which projects the team can easily tackle for the greatest impact">
      </div>
      <div class="note center">
        <p>(Above) A matrix that organized the team's ideas based on effort and impact</p>
      </div>
      <p>Based on the workshop outcomes, the team was able to prioritize items that would create the most impact for the least amount of effort. One of these items included introducing a mini-map in Flow Builder. The workshop exercise helped reveal that the flow react library the team leverages for Flow Builder actually has a built-in option to add a mini-map. Therefore, very little effort was required to make the update.</p>
      <div class="large-image-container">

      </div>
      <div class="note center">
        <p>(Above) The implemented mini-map</p>
      </div>
      <p>After introducing the mini-map, internal and external feedback concerning the navigability of Flow Builder was reduced by 99%.</p>

      
      <hr>
      <h3>General Flow Builder Improvement Workshop</h3>
<p>Working for a remote company doesn't introduce many opportunities to work with others in person; however, the Flow Builder team was fortunate enough to meet up in person for a few days in August, 2023. During this time, we spent an hour and a half brainstorming ideas that individual team members had to improve the Flow Builder experience.</p>
<div class="large-image-container">
  <img class="project-image-large image-border" src="images/projects/workshops/5_gen1.jpg"
    alt="Figjam exercise for choosing projects the engineers want to prioritize">
</div>
<div class="note center">
  <p>(Above) The Figjam prompt for the workshop</p>
</div>


<p>Similar to the navigability workshop, this workshop focused on first generating individual ideas and then coming back together for a group discussion. One unique facet of this session was the introduction of a “won't do” section. Instead of only generating ideas that the team thought would improve Flow Builder, team members also had the opportunity to push back on ideas that were already in our backlog or roadmap. While this section didn't get overly utilized during the workshop, the team had a few concerns to share about a couple backlog items.</p>     
<div class="large-image-container">
  <img class="project-image-large image-border" src="images/projects/workshops/6_gen2.jpg"
    alt="Impact Effort matrix for projects to prioritize according to engineering feedback">
</div>
<div class="note center">
  <p>(Above) General ideas and ideas related to AI enhancements organized into a matrix</p>
</div> 

<p>After generating ideas and voting on them, the team came together to discuss the ideas that received the most votes. These items ranged from ideas that were strictly BE initiatives to items that were purely related to the content we surface in-app. Once we walked through all the ideas, I again created an Impact Effort Matrix and shared it with the team. (During our in-person collaboration time, we also ideated on ways to leverage AI/ML within Flow Builder. Those items were added to the matrix as well.)</p>


<p>Once the Flow Builder team helped to properly organize the matrix, the Product Manager, Engineering Manager, and myself reviewed and added some of the items to our stretch goals for Q4 in 2023. One proposed project (updating the message builder 3rd party library) even made it onto the Q4 roadmap as a priority rather than a stretch goal.</p>

        <h2>Flow Builder Adoption</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Merchants spend the majority of their time on Postscript, an SMS marketing platform, creating and managing their SMS campaigns and automations.
          Flow Builder allows them to accomplish this more easily by introducing multi-message functionality within
          a single SMS campaign or automation.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>There is limited functionality and support for the current tools merchants are accustomed to using;
          however, merchants are wary of change and have been slow to adopt Flow Builder&mdash;in turn, missing
          out on improved features that can help make their jobs easier.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Legacy vs. Flow Builder</h3>
        <p>The legacy SMS campaign experience (below left) uses outdated design system components and has limited functionality
          such as a single-message restriction and lack of branching capabilities. Meanwhile, the Flow Builder experience (below right)
          supports single-message use cases as well as more complex flows that include important functionality
          like A/B testing.

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>As the lead Product Designer on the project, I interviewed merchants about their experience using Flow Builder.
          In addition to running customer interviews, I created a Pendo survey soliciting asynchronous feedback and utilized Amplitude
          to track Flow Builder usage. I also worked closely with Product and Engineering by conducting a workship to highlight
          opportunities for increasing adoption.

        <h3>Enhancements</h3>
      <p>We made the following updates to the product in hopes of boosting Flow Builder usage:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Surface a “Try Flow Builder” option within the legacy SMS campaign and automation experiences</li>
          <li>Add template options for SMS campaign and automation flows to make building flows easier</li>
          <li>Create an option to convert legacy SMS automations to automation flows</li>

        <h3>Objectives follow-up</h3>
        The updates we made to the experience resulted in an increase of ~700% for Flow Builder usage. We also saw 
        ~25% of merchants who interacted with the “Try Flow Builder” button continue to create a flow.
        </ul>

      <h2>Custom Variant Support</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Postscript, an SMS marketing platform, recently released new functionality
        (called Text-to-Buy) that allows customers to purchase products via the text thread.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>Since Text-to-Buy is still in Beta status, it does not provide all the capabilities
        merchants are seeking. On average, our enterprise level merchants have 5 options
        per product that require their customers to make a selection (e.g. size, color, etc.),
        but the current implementation requires merchants to make this choice on behalf of their
        customers. Since merchants have a limited knowledge of their customers' personal details,
        they opt out of using Text-to-Buy in its current state.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Original experience</h3>
      <p>Currently, the Text-to-Buy experience requires merchants to select a product
        and all its options before sending out a Text-to-Buy campaign.</p>

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>As the lead Product Designer on the project, I iterated through several ideas and shared them
        with the Postscript design team for feedback. After sharing the refined designs with Product and
        Engineering, I used UsabilityHub to run a series of usability tests, comparing different approaches.
        I shared the findings with my team and led a kickoff meeting where I aligned with Engineering on requirements.</p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>We ran two rounds of usability testing. For the first round, users ran through 2 mobile-simulated experiences
        on their computers. The first prototype had them place an order solely in the text thread, while the second
        prototype had users go back and forth between the text thread and a web checkout experience.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>80% of users said the text thread experience was easy to follow.</li>
        <li>80% of users said the web checkout experience was easy to follow.</li>
        <li>When asked to compare the two experiences, 60% of users preferred the text thread experience.</li>
        <li>"Texting is in the same spot for the customer to respond, which makes it easier for them to
          complete the task and order rather than navigating to another website." - Test Participant</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Since the results of the initial usability test were very similar, we decided to iterate on
        the two experiences further and test again. This time, we were able to test on mobile devices
        to ensure the most authentic experience for test participants. </p>
        <p>
        The first prototype still took
        place entirely in the text thread, but the selection process was simplified furthered. Meanwhile,
        the second prototype was updated so that only the first step took place in the text thread and
        the rest of the experience was on mobile web. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>~83% of users said the text thread experience was easy to follow.</li>
        <li>~67% of users said the web checkout experience was easy to follow.</li>
        <li>Overall, ~83% of users preferred the text thread experience over the web checkout experience.<br>

      <h3>New designs</h3>
      <p>Once we had our kickoff meeting surrounding the project, we uncovered some possible limitations
        in the winning Usability Hub design. Therefore, as an MVP, we slightly shifted our approach 
        by scaling back complexity and focusing on products that only have one customizable option.
        However, once we get validation from the new implementation, the team will spike on how we can
        leverage our data to make the winning design a reality.</p>

      <h3>Next steps</h3>
      <p>
        This project is currently in development, so we do not have any data surrounding our main
        objective around increasing Text-to-Buy usage. However, once the update is made, we will
        create product release materials to share with Postscript merchants and garner more feedback
        from the merchants that our currently using Text-to-Buy.

        <h2>House Rules</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Homeowners that use Vrbo, a vacation rental platform, set property rules travelers must agree to prior to booking. These rules encompass items like max
          occupancy, minimum renter age, allowance of pets, and several other rules.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Hosts cancel on travelers due to confusion surrounding house rules. Vrbo has over 13,000 cancellations
          annually because of house rules. The result is unhappy customers and a loss of revenue.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Original experience</h3>
        <p>There have been a lot of concerns surrounding the original house rules experience for both hosts and
          travelers. For example, one early study found travelers less inclined to book a property when custom notes
          were included in the house
          rules. (The outlined sections pictured above are areas for custom content.)</p>

      <h2>Cancel and change</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>When using Vrbo, a vacation rental platform, hosts must sometimes change or cancel a guest's reservation if the need arises.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>When a host cancels on a guest, everyone loses. The guest is disappointed, the host's search rank falls, and
        Vrbo loses out on revenue. Host cancellations contribute to 10% of reported guest pain points and current
        limitations of the reservations cancel and change capabilities lead to millions of dollars in operational
        costs&mdash;not including the revenue lost for Vrbo and hosts.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Original experience</h3>
      <h4>Canceling a reservation</h4>
      <p>The original cancel experience has led to a lack of trust between travelers and hosts. In this experience,

      <h4>Changing a reservation</h4>
      <p>The original change experience does not allow a host to add a payment request or issue a refund. These actions
        can be taken immediately following the flow, but there is little direction for hosts about how to handle these
        situations.</p>

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>As the lead Product Designer, I had weekly meetings with the Product Manager and Content Strategist on the
          project.</li>
        <li>During the host design team's UX critique meeting, I would often share my work for feedback.</li>
        <li>I researched competitor designs (like Airbnb and Booking.com).</li>
        <li>I presented the most recent designs to internal stakeholder for additional feedback and suggestions.</li>
        <li>The larger host design team held a design swarm where one of the flows explored was the host change flow.
          <ul>
            <li>We created artifacts such as how-might-we statements, core user flows, and sketches. (Pictured below)
            </li>
            <li>At the end of the swarm, we created a prototype that included a flow for changing a reservation.</li>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>While we are currently working with the research team to test the newest cancellation and change flows, we have
        gained some insights from the swarm usability study:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Participants appreciated a certain level of automation when approving guest-initiated changes</li>
        <li>Participants wanted to be notified of guest changes via several different communication channels</li>
        <li>When changing a reservation, participants admitted to only changing one item (like dates or guest count) at
          a time</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>New designs</h3>
      <p>Though we are still waiting on the next round of testing to begin, the new designs are based off previous
        research and extensive
        feedback.</p>
      <h4>Canceling a reservation</h4>
      <p>The new design adds friction against canceling at the top of the panel. We have also added a new required step of
        submitting additional context for every cancellation reason. </p>
      <div class="large-image-container">
        <img class="project-image-large" src="images/projects/cancel-change/cancel/new1.png"
          alt="The first step of the cancellation process, after a host selects their reason for canceling">
      </div>
      <p>For host cancellations, we want to require 100% refund for guests since it is not their fault for these kinds of
        cancellations.</p>

          alt="A screen with a disclaimer detailing what will happen when the host confirms the cancellation">
      </div>
      <p>Though we may not be able to prevent all cancellations, we can at least help prevent future cancellations by
        prompting hosts to sync their calendars and avoid double bookings. This coaching is specific to the reason the
        host is canceling on the guest.</p>

      </div>
      <h4>Changing a reservation</h4>
      <p>The options to change a reservation are now surfaced with the option to cancel. This allows for more
        scalability as change functionality grows.</p>
      <div class="large-image-container">

          alt="The list of options a host will see when choosing to change or cancel a reservation">
      </div>
      <p>The new design gives hosts the option to view their calendar availability when choosing to change a
        reservation's dates. In the past, host have provided feedback concerning how they prefer to view their
        availability via the calendar.</p>
      <div class="large-image-container">

          alt="A calendar view for hosts when selecting to change dates on a reservation">
      </div>
      <p>We have also included the ability to add a payment request or issue a refund within the change flow. The option
        presented will be based on a host's settings, but hosts are still able to override the selection.</p>

        While working on the vacation rental designs, we have also been working on designs for larger hosts like hotel
        owners. Our
        two products, vacation rentals and hotels, are headed towards convergence and the cancel/edit experiences lend
        themselves as an optimal place
        for consistency.

      <h2>Decline coaching</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Vrbo is a vacation rental platform that allows homeowners to rent out their property. Homeowners/hosts can approve or decline a traveler's request to book their property. The decline flow allows hosts to
        explain why they cannot host a guest.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>Host declines lead to disappointed travelers and a loss of revenue. Vrbo loses out on millions of dollars
        annually due
        to host declines. If hosts had an easier way to keep their settings and calendars up-to-date, a bulk
        of these declines could be prevented.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Original experience</h3>
      <p>The initial decline experience provides friction for hosts&mdash;possibly too much with the red symbol and
        dramatic red text. This design attempts to scare the host out of declining, rather than persuading them to
        approve.

      </div>
      <p>On the next step, hosts are bombarded with a confusing list of reasons. Once they select a reason, they are
        able to decline without any guidance on how to avoid missing out on future opportunities.</p>

        thoughtful UX feedback from the engineers in turn. I also shared the work-in-progress designs with the larger
        design team to ensure a variety of feedback.

      <h3>New designs</h3>
      <p>Based on user feedback, we were able to pare down the reasons for declining a reservation request. We also
        opted to add a step mid-flow to block a host's availability. Lastly, depending on the decline reason, we
        implemented coaching either mid-flow or post-flow to help hosts save requests or prevent future declines.</p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>We used an A/B test to determine if the new designs had a positive impact on booking acceptance rates and
        a negative impact on booking decline rates.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        After a few months, we were able to validate our designs and pushed the new experience live for all users.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Objectives follow-up</h3>
      <p>
        Since the new experience has been live for all users, we have seen the following changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Acceptance rate +2.3%</li>
        <li>Decline rate -2.9%</li>
        <li>The selection of the "Longer stay required" reason has drastically decreased. This is most likely due to the
          new
          design coaching hosts to edit the request instead of declining.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h3>Next steps</h3>
      <p>
        Since implementing new decline reasons, we have learned that many hosts are now selecting "Dates booked on another
        platform" (22%) when declining a booking request. This tells us that many hosts that list their properties on
        multiple websites are still not
        syncing their calendars between platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the new designs, we are exposing more hosts to the calendar sync functionality, but we still have a ways to
        go. The next step forward is to simplify the calendar sync process by exploring automation through app
        permissions.

      <h2>Inbox redesign</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>While interacting with Vrbo, a vacation rental platform, hosts spend the majority of their time managing reservations and messaging guests via their inbox. The inbox
        page is the second most visited page on Vrbo.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>The inbox is home to booking requests, guest messages, cancellations, and so much more. Therefore, it holds a
        lot of value. That being said, there is a lack of urgency with hosts responding to guests&mdash;especially when
        it comes to inquiries (messages without a booking request attached). 10% of Vrbo's revenue can be traced back to
        inquiries, but only 3% of inquiries turn into full-fledged reservations.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Original experience</h3>
      <p>The original design treats every message with the same sense of urgency. There is no indication of unread
        messages or actions a host needs to take on a specific reservation.</p>

        booking status, inline coaching maybe present to help hosts act more quickly when they need to. We have also added
        the estimated payout to inquiries and booking requests to help incentivize action.</p>
